Research IT Services (RITS) was the first team of research software engineers and research computing specialists in University College London.

The team was moved to the [**Centre for Advanced Research Computing**](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc) ([@UCL-ARC](https://github.com/UCL-ARC)) in 2022. 
This GitHub organisation is no longer actively used.
We keep the historic organisation as a home for old projects and archived repositories.

Unless you're here to browse old code, you probably want [@UCL-ARC](https://github.com/UCL-ARC) or [@UCL-ISD](https://github.com/UCL-ISD).
